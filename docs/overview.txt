   -  fix lighting bug
   -  change lighting to not be height-field based
   -  partial work on new tree layout

Previous stream:
   -  fog dist from view dist
   -  improve height-field
   -  other terrain features

Previous stream:
   -  threaded procgen&meshing

Previous stream:
   -  optimize rendering
      -  frustum culling
      -  limit # chunks rebuilt per frame
   -  use more textures
   -  vertex ambient occlusion
   -  launch one light source at a time
   -  optimize mesh building
   -  optimize terrain generation

Previous stream:
  - cache procedural genation chunks
  - build & cache meshes
  - render them poorly
