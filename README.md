# obbg - Open Block Building Game

This is a retired, unfinished demo (game?) that uses / demonstrates
stb_voxel_render.h.

See docs/overview.txt for information about the scope
of the project, and docs/todo.txt for some idea of
what's up next.

# License

Currently the license for this code is public domain.

However:
* I am willing to change the license to something
more restrictive if this will make others more willing
to contribute to it, e.g. zlib/BSD-like or even LGPL.
(This is different from my libraries in that it is
relatively standalone, so I have less issues with the
more restrictive license.) If you feel like you would
be a heavy contributor if only the license was different,
let me know.
* At some point I may fork this project to make a
closed-source game. So don't contribute to it while
it's PD if that sort of thing bothers you. (Of course
everyone else will be doing this, but you might perceive
it is me fishing for people to add stuff to use for my
(theoretical) closed-source game. It's not, but it's
not worth worrying about if that's an issue for you.)
